				<h4>Usability</h4>
				<p>When a producer design a product or system for the users, they need to consider the usability of the products and systems whether it is easier to use and more closely to user’s needs and requirements. “Usability is the degree to which something - software, hardware or anything else - is easy to use and a good fit for the people who use it”(Usability Professionals Association，2010).</p>

				<h4>Definition</h4>
				<p>As Nielsen (1993), usability of systems or products are have multi-faceted and the usability have five properties which is easy to learn; easy to remember; efficient to use; meets user satisfaction and low error rate.<br />“The ISO has defined usability as "The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." ”(ISO 1994, as cited in Chen, Germain, & Rorissa, 2009).<br />This definition can be expanded, and made more comprehensive which are include five elements and necessary to create a usable system:<br /><br />Efficiency: How quickly a specified goal can be achieved.<br />Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they re-establish proficiency?<br />Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?<br />Satisfaction: what do users think about the products ease of use? How pleasant to use the product.<br />Learnability: How easy is it for users to complete the basic tasks and achieve goals during the test?</p>

				<h4>Design Principles</h4>
				<p>According to Gould & Lewis (1985), Most of the usability of designing for a product or a system, they are focus on 3 design principles which are early focuses on users and tasks, empirical measurement, iterative design. Therefore, the products or systems for users must be easy to use, easily to learn, quickly to remember how to use it and useful to users.</p>

				<h4>Testing Methodology</h4>
				<p>According to Nielsen (1994) indicated Usability Testing is a technique applied in user-centered interaction design to make an evaluation of a product through testing it by users.<br />Researchers can create a scenario or realistic condition sets up Usability Testing, and then users are assigned some tasks during the scenario. Wherein the users operate the product to perform these tasks while observers observe and take notes about the testing result. And researchers are able to understand how real users experience your product through the scenario.</p>

				<h4>One-on-one Interview</h4>
				<p>An individual interview is an interview between two people directly which are face-to-face, interview thought the phone or videoconference. One to one interview is one of the individual interviews. “One-on-one discussions with users show you how a particular user works. They enable you to get detailed information about a user's attitudes, desires, and experiences”(U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,n.d.).In this method, researcher will talk to one user individual. And this interview allows researcher probe user’s attitudes, beliefs, desires, and experiences of the product or system. During the interviews, researchers able to ask users some short answer’s question or rank choices.</p>

				<h4>Inductive Approach for Analysing Data</h4>
				<p>“Inductive analysis refers to approaches that primarily use detailed readings of
raw data to derive concepts, themes, or a model through interpretations made from the raw data by an evaluator or researcher”(Thomas, 2006). The researchers collect information based on behavior from the research and then study the data they collect to determine if there are any correlations that could indicate a pattern or support a universal theory. It begins with data gathering, categorizing, and then develops a theory or hypothesis.<br />Research undertaken by combined analysing approaches seems more consummate. “purely inductive research, undertaken with no preconceived ideas to direct one’s attention while observing, is impossible or put us into a state of “blooming, buzzing, confusion” (Vogt, Gardne, Haeffele & Vogt, 2014).</p>

					<h4>Experimental Procedures</h4>
					<p>Begin voice and video recordings.<br /><br />Present the participant with the app on the device, say:<br />“We are conducting a usability test on a game designed for blind users. We are going to blindfold you, put you in the tutorial of the game, then we would like you to get you to level 3 (hunt the third animal) of the game HUNT. Do you have any questions?”<br />“Please sign the consent form”.<br />“Position your hands so you do not accidentally touch the edge of the tablet when you think you are touching the screen. If we see you missing the screen, we will move your hands for you.”<br /><br />Sign the consent form, blindfold participant, launch the app and put them in the tutorial.<br /><br />When they reach level 3, or they appear unable to reach level 3, the test stops.<br /><br />Offer to let them play the game with their eyes open, but with the visual aids off.<br /><br />Ask the participant: “What do you think of the app?”<br /><br />Record voice response. If the participant gives a short answer, probe with more questions:<br />“What did you find enjoyable?”<br />“Did you have any issues?”<br />“What would you change?”</p>

					<h4>Result</h4>
					<p><img src="attachment/result form.png" width="600px"/><br />The above table shows the result of participant with blindfold and play the “hunt” game through the voice. Each row represents the time of complete the task in each participant.<br />Follow the result, we can see the Participant 3 have spend less time to learn the tutorial which is 0.85mins, however, this participant spend the longest time among all. Also the participant 2 has spend the longest time among all in tutorial, and this participant 2 only spend 0.9mins to find the “hunt” game.<br />According to the records, it can be obviously seen that spend time and listen careful during the tutorial is very helpful for using this “Audio Hub” Application.<br /><br />As this experiment nets qualitative data rather than quantitative, it is more difficult to immediately take away a clear understanding of the usability of the software. It was not feasible to test for errors, or time taken to complete as task as the software is designed as a game. As such, it is difficult to quantify just how much fun someone had playing the game, or how usable the software is.<br /><br /><strong>The satisfaction level is irrelevant with the capability of playing the game.</strong><br /><br />As this software is designed to be a game, usability becomes less about how efficient a user is at completing a given task, or how many errors they make, and more about how easy they found the game to play and how much fun they had. In this case, our data becomes more purposeful.
The participants overall found the Hunt game enjoyable, citing the sound effects and lack of vision to be the main factors. This added a new element to the game that is rarely used in smart device games. The lack of vision supposedly increased their sensitivity to sound and made the game feel more realistic.<br /><br /><strong>Difficulties or Issues</strong><br /><br />Some issues were found with the game’s navigation and accessibility. All the participants had issues finding the game Hunt, with 75% of participants starting the wrong game before being directed into the correct game. The upon reflection during the interview, the issues seemed to stem from the user not understanding the basic layout of the menu, where options are arranged horizontally and vertically, and commands to swipe across seem to be missed. Another feature that gave users trouble was the fact that the swipe gesture is in a different direction than normal. That is, to swipe right you move your finger from left to right, as opposed to the more common right-to-left movement of modern smart device applications.<br />Another issue to point out was the fact that there is no discernible, physical difference between the edge of the screen and the beginning of the screen’s bezel/the edge of the tablet. This means that a player could run their finger off the edge of the screen and onto the bezel, triggering an action when they aren't aware of what they’ve done. A fix for this that we could have implemented was to line the edges of the screen with tape so participants could feel where the edge of the screen was and not go over this. However, this would make the experiment less like a real-life scenario where a player is using a regular tablet, so we decided against it.<br /><br /><strong>The degree of difficulty of the game is high.</strong><br /><br />Participants also had trouble completing the game successfully, with many needing multiple attempts to progress to the next level. They reported a difficulty with the audio cue of the target, and after the experiment was conducted and they played with the visual aids on they quickly identified a key issue: as the target in Hunt moved quickly to a new location, the frequency of the audio blip cue did not change until the target was static. This meant it was impossible to hear the target when it changed locations quickly, leading to fruitless searches and missed arrows.<br />Participants found it difficult to hit the target even after repeated tries. From our standpoint, it appeared that the audio cue/frequency of the target location sound was not linear enough for users to accurately locate the target. This could be viewed as a gameplay mechanic. but as the one progresses through the levels of Hunt the movement speed of the target increases, thus making it harder.This means that the audio cues add an element of difficulty not intended for the game, and more of an accident.<br />An issue that must be mentioned with the usability of the software, particularly the direction of the voice instructions or cues within the app and our experiment is that for all of our participants, English is their second language. This cannot be discerned as a cause for the difficulty some had in navigation, but is an aspect to consider. All subjects were fluent in English but found some of the narrator cues hard to understand when hearing it once.<br />In conclusion, the participants all found the application to be enjoyable to use, though there was difficulty in navigating the menus. Participants did not ask for a tutorial at any point throughout it, or for the game to be restarted to hear the instructions again. From a player’s perspective, the app was certainly enjoyable. The soundscape and gameplay were interesting and challenging, but some issues with the audio mechanics left the players feeling frustrated at times.
However, from a usability standpoint, the conclusion must be drawn that the app is certainly functioning, usable and most importantly fun, but some issues with navigation and physical limitations mean some frustration is had by participants.</p>

					<h5><strong>Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences - Networks and Security</strong></h5>
					<p>This assignment was exciting for me as I had never conducted an experiment like this before. I have had a lot of experience reading about experiments and editing essays about them, but to finally conduct my own was exciting. The planning stage of the experiment was brief; as it would be difficult to produce quantitative data as results, we decided to simply let people play navigate the game and play the app on their own to see what they did, and how. This was very open ended but allowed users to have an organic learning experience of the app, without us moving them ahead to the game without learning about how the app worked. Making mistakes and learning from them is a key part of this learning process, and we got to see it first-hand with this experiment.<br />I found conducting the experiment to be eye-opening, watching how people interact with the application. I’ve had many new experiences with applications or games myself, and I've  introduced games to others and watched them learn, but I've never seen it in action like I did with this experiment.<br />Setting up the experiment was possibly my favourite part of this assignment. Our setup involved a participant sat at a desk, with a tablet PC in front of them with headphones connected, me with a laptop sat opposite them, with a phone recording audio next to them, and a phone recording video from a small tripod next to me. The video phone recording the tablet’s screen and how the participant used the application, and the audio phone recorded voice for the questions.<br />Something I would do differently next time would be to put more consideration into the planning phase of the experiment. When conducting the experiment, we made some changes almost after each participant. One participant asked if he could play the game with the visual aids turned on, and we agreed, realising this was a good idea for them to get a better understanding of how the app worked and how the game mechanics played. After this we offered the participants the option of playing with the visual aids on. All participants agreed they would like to play while being able to see the game, after the experiment.<br />Another thing I would do differently would be to be more direct and forward while conducting the experiment. What I mean by this is at during the experiment participants would occasionally turn off the visual aids, meaning the video camera couldn’t see what they were doing. We immediately noticed this, but waited for a bit before turning them back on out of fear or politeness towards the participant. This was unnecessary because the participant wouldn’t be able to know if we turned on the visual aids again, and it only affected us by blocking what was on the screen, so when we came to watching the video back there are blank parts.<br />I also very much enjoyed working in this group. Of all the group projects I've worked with over my three years at AUT this one has been the most focused and hard-working. They immediately all offered ideas and discussed how to design the experiment when we were in that phase, and were all uniquely useful in conducting the experiment and writing the document.</p>

					<h5><strong>Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences - Software Development</strong></h5>
					<p>We have four members in the team for this research project, which are Wilson Thrush Marsh, Tiantian Zhan, Duan Hao, Jiangtao Zhu.<br />The team has done the research of learnability and satisfaction of the “Audio Hub” game in human computer interaction. We design a good research plan before we start the research. Therefore we have done a good team performance of this project. During this research, we have been made sure every participant was understood the“Audio Hub” game , and how human interactive with this game. And for our team cooperation, each of us is a researcher. We were creating a scenario for this project together and helping each other.<br />We have set the final task to our participants that are getting into the “Hunt” game and shoot the third animal for testing learnability and satisfaction.<br />Firstly, participants need to listen and learn how to operating in this application during the “Audio Hub” tutorial. After the tutorial, our participants should be able to find the “Hunt” game from game menu and then start the game. We have found 4 volunteers to do this test with blindfold eyes and recorded by video. During the test, we have observed the user’s behaviors and attitudes. And our participants also have the experienced in another two situations. One of the situation is turn off the screen, and then participants playing with wide eyes. And another situation is playing the game as normal. Interestingly, The observations are showing that the satisfaction of the game is irrelevant whether the participants have high level of playing the games. The volunteers are also preferred playing the game with blindfold eyes because it is more excite and curiosity than the screen off with wide eyes. Thus, we believe that blindfold eyes is more learnability and satisfaction than keep the eyes open.<br />In the project，I have the experience of playing the blindness’s game. And I have learned the usability of this “Audio Hub” game, which is mainly focus on learnability and satisfaction. According to the usability principles, learnability is how easy to learn by users, and satisfaction is what do users think about the products ease of use; How pleasant to use the product. On the other hand, users are very difficult to control the tablet when their eyes are blindfolded and needs to operating the system by listening the tutorial. However, people still feel enjoyable playing the game when their have blindfold eyes. Fortunately, all of our team members are studying computer and information science and we also have the experiences of web development. Thus, we all understand that user interface of website pages or other products must be keep in simple and easy to be used of their users.</p>

					<h5><strong>Graduate Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences</strong></h5>
					<p>How it goes<br />This project aims to study the usability of the AudioHub game, more specifically, the learnability and satisfaction of the game. We set up a final goal for the participants and asked them to solve it out by themselves with their eyes covered. Then we recorded necessary data and how they reached the goal on video. After we gathered the data, we basically used inductive approach(exploratory analysis) to analyze the data to reach our goal.<br />Role in the project<br />Because we are doing a team work and it is not a big task, our roles in the project is not clearly different with each other. We all participated in every part of the project with our heart. As for me, I focused more on researching the methodologies, recording data and organizing our team work.<br />Previous experience<br />I had experience conducting a survey. Compared with this project, it is easier to analyze the data and make conclusion from a survey but harder to propose targeted, reasonable and practical hypotheses. As for me, quantitative data are more convincible but there are more qualitative data in this project to analyze which is a big challenge.<br />What I learned from it<br />A good preparation and a thoroughly understanding of different usability methodologies is essential and necessary, which could save many troubles during the experiment and make the process of analyzing data easier. During our experiment, we start to aware of the deficiencies of the methodology we adopt and how to improve it (which is a little bit late to change this time). For example, we choose exploratory analysis (inductive approach) to analyze data (naïve), it’s difficult to avoid optimistic bias even though it is flexible to generate hypotheses. Actually, I think it would be better if we combine it with deductive approach to implement our project. I believe all of us gain valuable experience in this project which would promote ourselves analyzing data in a more scientific way in the future.</p>

					<p>This project aim is to study on the usability of a game named AudioHub. We select one-on-one interview as our usability testing methodology, and the final report is in web form.<br />At first, I was a little bit confusing about what we were going to do. fortunately, I got support from my team. We discussed together about the topic, methodology, target to achieve, etc.<br />I learned some basic concepts in usability and its testing methodology. Web skill is a crucial element in this project. I used to be a website editor before my GD study, it mainly focused on front-end design and implement. For this report, I used my skills on web development to make this responsive web report.<br />As a team based project, team work is always the most important. And a successful project without efficient team communication. Thanks to the great team, we cooperated quite well. The team strongly bond together towards to the project.<br />I think I learned valuable experience from this project, and it is helpful not only in the future project, but also the whole career.</p>
